# Chimie

Chimie is an interative web app designed to display information about the periodic table. :microscope:

It relies on the [Chimie API](https://chimie-api.herokuapp.com/) built by [Jorge Weiss](https://github.com/JAWeiss89). 

We hope you enjoy this experience! We are investing our best HTML, CSS, and JS skills into this project. :computer:

Mobile-first design :iphone: and an accessible UX :wheelchair: are top-of-mind as we build this project.
